Pseudocode Assignment: Go Fish


Shuffle your deck of cards;

Deal 7 cards to each player;

Place the remaining stack of cards in the center of the group of players;

while (until everybody has done the following) {
If the player has pairs already:
             Player removes cards from hand and places them in a pile next to them;
If the player does not have pairs:
             Do nothing;
}

Designate a player to begin the first round;

while (until there are no more pairs to be made){
If the player does not have any cards in their hand:{
             If there are still cards in the stack in the center:
                          The player draws one card from the stack in the center;
             If there are no cards left in the stack in the center:
                          Skip that player's turn; //They are essentially out of the game
}
If the player has cards in their hand: {
The player will look at their hand again and decide which card they want to make a pair out of;

They will ask another player if they have that card;

If the player who is asked has the requested card:
            That player gives the card to the player who asked for it;
If the player who is asked does not have the card:
            That player will say "Go fish";
            
            If there are still cards left in the stack in the center of the group:
                The player who asked for the card draws a card from the stack in the center of the group;
                
            If there are no more cards in the stack in the center of the group:
                The player who asked for the card does nothing;
}
Move on to next turn;
}

while (until everybody has done the following) {

Player counts up how many pairs they have;
}

If there is a tie in the amount of pairs:
        Game is a draw;
If only one player has the most amount of pairs:        
        That player wins;
