Pseudocode Assignment: Go Fish

How to play Go Fish:
Step one: Shuffle your deck of cards.
Step two: Deal 7 cards to each player.
Step three: Place the remaining stack of cards in the center of the group of players.
Step four: Look at the cards in your hand. The goal of the game is to have the most pairs by the time the cards run out.
Step five: If you have pairs:
             Remove the cards from your hand and place them in a pile next to you.
             Don't have any pairs? Do nothing.
Step six: Designate a player to begin the first round.
Step seven: This player will look at their hand again and decide which card they want to make a pair out of.
Step eight: Then, they will ask a player if they have that card.
Step 9: The player who is asked will say:
          If they have the card that they were asked of, then they give the card to the player that asked for them.
          If they do not have the card, then they say "Go fish". The play who orignially asked for the card will draw a card from the stack of cards in the center of the group.
