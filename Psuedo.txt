Pseudocode Assignment: Go Fish

How to play Go Fish:
Step one: Shuffle your deck of cards.
Step two: Deal 7 cards to each player.
Step three: Place the remaining stack of cards in the center of the group of players.
Step four: Look at the cards in your hand. The goal of the game is to have the most pairs by the time the cards run out.
Step five: If you have pairs:
             Remove the cards from your hand and place them in a pile next to you.
             Don't have any pairs? Do nothing.
Step six: Designate a player to begin the first round.
Step seven: This player will look at their hand again and decide which card they want to make a pair out of.
Step eight: Then, they will ask any other player if they have that card.
Step nine: The player who is asked will:
          If they have the card that they were asked for, they give the card to the player that asked for it. If you have multiple cards  
          of the same number, you only give one of them. Do NOT give more than one card at a time.
          If they do not have the card, then they say "Go fish". The person who orignially asked for the card will draw a card from the             stack of cards in the center of the group.
Step ten: If the player was able to obtain a cards from somebody, they are able to repeat steps seven to nine. If not, they move on to               step eleven.
Step eleven: End of round. Move to step 12.
Step twelve: The person to the left of the player who just had their turn will now repeat steps seven to eleven until all 52 cards are paired.
Step thirteen: Once all the cards are paired, each player will count up the amount of pairs that they have. The person with the most                      amount of pairs wins the game.
